This repository presents all the projects which are a practical implamantation of my skills gained so far. Here is a brief description of each of them:

### 1. Analysis of a current stage of improvements in Sustainable development goal number 8.

__Skills used:__ data visualising in PowerBI, market research, conduction of exploratory data analysis, providing insights for solving problems in this case.

__Short description:__ This project creates an overview on the degree of improvement of the nations through human improvement index, together with a top level view on sustainable improvement aim indicator 8.1.1. From this assignment I can show that there virtually is a advantageous correlation among GDP in keeping with capita boom and lifestyles fine variables from HDI.

To make this research, I made such steps as understanding of the use case and market research, creating the research statement and question, finding of datasets, statistics expertise or statistics selection, implementation of summary statistics into a dashboard using boxplot, histoghraph, filled map, slicers and scatter plots and correlations.

The research itself showed that while the average life expectancy and years of schooling do not have a huge gaps (comparing to previous levels of human development), the biggest difference in these 4 indexes is shown in GDP, which naturally leads to the examine a question 'What is the correlation between GDP per capita and two other variables of HDI?'. This will help the understanding of whether or not money is the key influence on the quality of life.
